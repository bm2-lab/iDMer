# iDMer: an integrative Data and Mechanism-driven epidemic response system to identify compound interventions for sudden virus outbreak

iDMer is presented to identify compound interventions for any virus as long as the viral genome is sequenced. It consists of three mechanism-oriented compound identification modules, i.e. the virus-host interaction-oriented module, the autophagy-oriented module, and the cytokine release syndrome-oriented (CRS-oriented) module. In addition, the evaluation of the predicted compound toxicities evaluation and the identification of compound combinations identification for virus treatment with clear mechanisms are also incorporated into iDMer as a one-stop integrative platform.
